					<h4>Multiple Choice</h4>
			  		<p style="padding-bottom:10px;">These items take an average of one minute to answer and have four answer choices labeled as you would see on the real STAAR test: A,B,C,D or F,G,H,I for alternating items.

			  		<h4>Cognitive Complexity</h4>
			  		<p>STAAR Test Maker follows the Texas Education Agency’s guidelines when classifying the cognitive complexity of test items. Low, Moderate and High Complexity describe the demands an item may make on a student. We built these classifications into STAAR Test Maker allowing Educators to sort and select test items by cognitive complexity as appropriate for the tested benchmark.</p>

Bubble Grids used in Gridded Response test items contain four, five, six, or seven columns with each column containing the digits 0 through 9 enclosed in bubbles. These test items take an average of ninety seconds to answer.</p>
